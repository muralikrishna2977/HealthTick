1. Viewing Existing Bookings:
When the application loads, all onboarding and follow-up slot bookings are automatically fetched and displayed in the calendar view. This provides an immediate overview of all scheduled appointments.

2. Navigating the Calendar:
You can navigate through different dates using the left and right arrow buttons at the top of the screen. This allows you to easily browse bookings across various days.

3. Using the Date Picker:
Located on the left side of the screen, the date picker enables you to quickly jump to a specific date without manually scrolling through the calendar. It offers a faster way to access any desired day.

4. Booking a Slot:
To create a new booking, click the "Select Client" button. A pop-up will appear prompting you to choose the client and call type. After making your selections, click the "Select Slot" button to save the booking.

5. Booking Behavior Based on Call Type:
When a follow-up slot is created, it is automatically scheduled to repeat weekly on the same day and time.
When an onboarding slot is created, it is scheduled only for that particular date and time.

6. Slot and Form Validation:
If the selected time slot overlaps with an existing booking, a warning will prompt you to choose a different slot.
While selecting the client and call type, if any required field is left empty, a warning will prompt you to complete all selections before proceeding.

7. Managing Slots in the Calendar:
In the calendar view, you can click on any available time slot to book it. If a slot is no longer needed, you can easily delete it by clicking the "Delete" button associated with that slot.
